# Engineering Cloud Scaling Policies with Slingshot

This is the home of the Slingshot project that consists of these parts: 
* A framework called *Slingshot Framework* based on [event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture)
* The *Slingshot Simulator* that has the necessary plugins for simulating PCM and SPD.
* The *Scaling Policy Definition (SPD)* language to model your scaling policies on the architectural-level
*
